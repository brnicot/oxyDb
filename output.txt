Being so high in the air affords an unprecedented view of the world
it also gives
a different mindset to those whom allow themselves to think freely.
The Statue of Kunlun's Greatest Philosopher
stands proudly in the middle of town
ready to
inspire great thoughts from all those that gaze upon him. All around Kunlun are spectacular Overlooks of the World.
But there are particular spots that are exceptionally breathtaking
please watch your step.
There is a small hill in Kunlun that is said to of been the Great Philosophers favorite meditation spot
you should visit there and see if any grand thoughts take you.
No matter how great a culture is
there will always be a few among its citizenry that just don't 'get it'.
Those in Kunlun's history that always thought small eventually truly shrank
and eventually disappeared.
But before that time they had a Mini-town that they lived in on ground beneath Kunlun.
That place is an object lesson against stagnant thinking.

Louyang is a spiritual country
where the warrior spirit and clear thinking are highly prized.
Such wondrous sites such as the Statue of the Man and the Tiger may inspire you to do your best.
Louyang has a different perspective on healing the mind and the body. While Rune-Midgard relies on the science of potions
and Faith for healing
the Louyang healers practice their art at a 'Hospital'.
At a Hospital
your body will be cured by a system of body manipulations and diet.
The beautiful Palace that is protected by the Great Wall of Louyang is truly a sight to behold for every visitor.
To go along with their proud heritage of Martial Arts and spirit training
they often practice making their bodies
more robust through exercise. Some of these exercises target the legs others the Lungs.
Outside Louyang some practice their Shouting on the Tower. If you have seen all these sites in Louyang
you will have quite a few good memories to take home.

Part of the Philosophy involves many hours of meditation a day to keep balance in your mind and body.
You should visit the Shrine in Ayothaya and meditate upon your life's journey.
And when you complete your regimen of Exercise and Introspection you can refuel your body by visiting
the Tom Yum Goong restaurant. The famous soup made here is truly delicious.
Don't leave Ayothaya without sampling the dishes there.
[Don't forget to take photos of all these things
and show them to your Tour Guide.]";}i:5444;a:3:{s:2:"id";s:4:"7534";s:4:"name";s:28:"Amatsu Completed Photo Album";s:4:"desc";s:130:"Upon seeing all the sites and sights in Amatsu the Rune Midgard Tour Agency has stamped this photo album with their official seal.";}i:5445;a:3:{s:2:"id";s:4:"7535";s:4:"name";s:28:"Kunlun Completed Photo Album";s:4:"desc";s:130:"Upon seeing all the sites and sights in Kunlun the Rune Midgard Tour Agency has stamped this photo album with their official seal.";}i:5446;a:3:{s:2:"id";s:4:"7536";s:4:"name";s:29:"Louyang Completed Photo Album";s:4:"desc";s:131:"Upon seeing all the sites and sights in Louyang the Rune Midgard Tour Agency has stamped this photo album with their official seal.";}i:5447;a:3:{s:2:"id";s:4:"7537";s:4:"name";s:30:"Ayothaya Completed Photo Album";s:4:"desc";s:132:"Upon seeing all the sites and sights in Ayothaya the Rune Midgard Tour Agency has stamped this photo album with their official seal.";}i:5448;a:3:{s:2:"id";s:4:"7538";s:4:"name";s:13:"Sand for Work";s:4:"desc";s:3:"...";}i:5449;a:3:{s:2:"id";s:4:"7539";s:4:"name";s:11:"Poring Coin";s:4:"desc";s:50:"A small coin with a monster Poring engraved in it.";}i:5450;a:3:{s:2:"id";s:4:"7540";s:4:"name";s:13:"Lotto Ball 39";s:4:"desc";s:60:"The number ''39''
